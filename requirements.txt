# Runtime Dependencies for Max Min Integration
#
# This file lists Python packages required for the integration to run in production.
# Currently empty because this integration only uses Home Assistant core libraries.
#
# Home Assistant automatically installs dependencies listed here when the integration loads.
# Format: package_name>=version (one per line)
#
# For detailed dependency information, see DEPENDENCIES.md
#
# Future additions should follow this format:
# requests>=2.25.0
# aiohttp>=3.8.0
